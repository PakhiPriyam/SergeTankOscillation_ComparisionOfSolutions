The study uses 4 methods to solve surge tank equations, comparing them with experiments and exploring design considerations. Python in Google Colab.



## Abstract
This study focuses on applying four distinct numerical methods—Explicit Euler, second, third, and fourth-order Runge-Kutta—to the governing equations of surge tanks, involving sets of nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The investigation encompasses two case studies: the first scrutinizes these methods against experimental results, while the second explores variations in oscillating water depth through adjustments in the head loss coefficient and surge tank area, yielding design recommendations. The simulations are conducted using the PYTHON programming language within the GOOGLE COLAB environment.

These case studies extend from Chapter 3 of Ali EL-Turki's 2013 thesis titled "Modeling of Hydraulic Transients in Closed Conduits" and an article authored by Dr. Karan Abdulghani Ramadan and Dr. Hatem Mustafa in 2013, addressing "Surge Tank Design Considerations for Controlling Water Hammer Effects at Hydro-electric Power Plants."

The findings of this study suggest that RK4 and RK3 methods are suitable for Case 1 scenarios, and propose the consideration of a surge tank cross-sectional area of 400 m² or alternatively, the installation of parallel surge tanks with areas ranging from 200 m² to 300 m².
